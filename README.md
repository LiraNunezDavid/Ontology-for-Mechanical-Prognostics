# Ontology-for-Mechanical-Prognostics
This **ontology** is in the *development phase*, and is used to store information coming from fault diagnosis events in mechanical components using monitoring techniques. Thus, queries can be made about what kind of condition monitoring technique that should be used and how. In addition, inferences have been made so that depending on a collected value can be it compared with boundaries determined by ISO standard to know if said reading presents a value considered GOOD, SATISFACTORY, ALERT or ALARM. Thus, if a ALERT value is collected, the prognosis of a failure is being performed, sending a manutence message for intervention in the machine.
The next steps are, after identifying an ALERT message, it must be linked to diagnostic information of mechanical component being analyzed, to will be identified the failure mode and its potential causes. In this way the maintenance intervention is more directed, ceasing to be exploratory.
