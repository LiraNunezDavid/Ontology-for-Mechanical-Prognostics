# Ontology-for-Mechanical-Prognostics
This ontology is in the development phase, and is used to store information coming from fault diagnosis events in mechanical components. Also, queries can be made about what kind of condition monitoring technique should be used and how. In addition, inferences have been made so that depending on a collected value can be it compared with boundaries determined by ISO standard to know if said reading presents a value considered GOOD, SATISFACTORY, ALERT or ALARM. Thus, if a ALERT value is collected, the prognosis of a failure is being performed for a maintenance intervention. The next steps are, after identifying an ALERT message, it must be linked to diagnostic information and the mechanical component to identify the mode failure and its potential causes.
